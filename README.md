# TSA_RandomizerAppIsAJoke
After hearing the news that the TSA has spent at least $300,000 on an app that randomizes a left or right arrow, I wanted to produce one of my own to see if I too can produce an app worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Just to reconfirm - I have no affiliation with the TSA, with IBM, or with anythign to do with the original app or contract. This is a personal project as much as a challenge to myself and a question unto the TSA's valuation ability.

This project was a good way of testing out some very basic design, and fun to get an idea from paper to phone in pretty short time. It also worked as a good project to get my head more and more around github. To that end, it has cleared a lot of things up, and also revealed a bunch of things that are harder than I thought. Onwards and upwards with that.


The code uses the inbuilt Java random number generator to return either 0 or 1. These will in turn make a left or right handed arrow appear and slowly fade away under an inbuilt animation.

That is the full functionality of this app.
